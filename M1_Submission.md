Instructions
Create a repository on github, use the format [course]-[section] as the repository name.
Make sure it's set to private
Go to Settings -> Manage Access -> Invite Collaborator -> Search for my ID MattToegel and send an invite; if your section has a grader do the same for their github id
Note: Once in a while the invite doesn't get created correctly and you'll need to resend it, keep an eye on the acceptance of the invite since this is required for further HW validations. A comment will be left on Canvas for the submission if the invite is missing at the time of grading).
From the terminal / command line create a new branch called M1-GettingStarted
Create a README.md file and add it to the branch
Fill in some basic details:
Course/Section
Your name (first is fine)
Brief info about yourself you'd like to share

git push origin M1-GettingStarted
Create a pull request from this branch (via github.com)
Don't merge/close the pull request yet
create a new file called M1_Submission.md (the content of this output will be inserted there)
Once done, add, commit, push the submission md file, then you may merge the Pull Request
