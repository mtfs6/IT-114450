Create a new branch for this assignment
Go through the socket lessons and get each part implemented (parts 1-3)
Create a new folder called Part3HW

Add/commit/push the branch
Create a pull request to main and keep it open
Copy the the Part3 code into this new folder
Git add/commit all of the sample code and the Part3HW code
Implement two of the following server-side activities for all connected clients (majority of the logic should be processed server-side and broadcasted to all clients if/when applicable)
Simple number guesser where all clients can attempt to guess
Hint: may want separate commands to start, stop, and guess (or starting lasts for x rounds then stops)
No need to implement complexities like strikes
Coin toss command (random heads or tails)
Dice roller given a command and text format of "roll #d#" (i.e., roll 2d6)
